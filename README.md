# Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization
### Author: Dylan Mendonca

This repository contains a few programming assignments I completed for the Data Science Specialization offered by John's Hopkins University on Coursera [[Link]](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science?).

The repository is organized by course number and name. Each folder has a README or PDF describing the assignment/task.
